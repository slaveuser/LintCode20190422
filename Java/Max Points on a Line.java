ç»™list of (x,y) coordinates. Determine  # of points on the same line

#### Observation
- If given n points, we can calculate all possible slopes. O(n^2) times
- For the two dots that generates the same slope, these dots could be on **parallel** slopes
- figure out how to prune the parallel dots

#### Trick: prune parallel dots using greatest common divider
- GCD: greatest common divider
- Devide the x and y by their greatest common divider, such that x and y can be reduced to minimum value
- All other x and y can be reduced to such condition as well
- track the final reduced (x,y) in a map: they are the key to the count
- No need to use Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>> to perform 2 level mapping; just `map<String, Integer>`, where the key is "x@y"

/*
DP not applicable:
IF it's a N x N board, with max value restricted by value n x n, dp approach is feasible, because the board is bounded.
However, this question does not specify the board, but rather a list of points, where the value can be extremely large (not feasible to define dp[n][n])

Thoughts about DP
- Build N x N boolean[][], and assign points 
- dp[x][y]: max number of points to this point
- there can be 8 directions towards 1 (x,y), and half of direction overlaps
- Assume the 4 directions: right-diagonal, DOWN, left-diagonal, right
- add status to dp[x][y][directionStatus]: on spot (x,y), what's the max # points coming from this direction?
- function: dp[x][y][status] = board[x][y] ? dp[lastX][lastY][status] + 1 : 0;
where lastX = x - dx[status];
- init: 
dp[0][y][any status] = board[0][y] ? 1 : 0; 
dp[x][0][any status] = board[x][0] ? 1 : 0;
