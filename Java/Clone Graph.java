tags: DFS, BFS, Graph

给一个graph node, 每个node有list of neighbors. 复制整个graph, return new head node.
       
实现起来就好像在crawl urls.

#### 思想
- Use HashMap to mark cloned nodes.    
- 先能复制多少Node复制多少. 然后把neighbor 加上
- Use `map<oldNode, newNode>` to mark visited

#### DFS
- Given graph node obj `{val, list of neighbor}`: copy the node and all neighbors
- Mark visited using map<oldNode, newNode>
- for loop on the each one of the neighbors: map copy, record in map, and further dfs
- once dfs completes, add newNeighbor as neighbor of the new node (get to it via map)
- 主要思想是: 一旦复制过了, 不必要重新复制

#### BFS
- Copy the root node, then copy all the neighbors. 
- Mark copied node in map.
- Use queue to contain the newly added neighbors. Need to work on them in the future.

/*
Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.

OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
Visually, the graph looks like the following:

       1
      / \
     /   \
    0 --- 2
         / \
